Docs: external tables let you query structured data in external data stores
In own words:
From my current exposure to BQ, external tables look like smart parsers, 
integrated into the BigQuery ecosystem by smart abstraction.

that kinda implements a table interface (allowing usual table ops on it), 
with all the fetching ops using external storage for the actual 
data (structured using provided or parsed schema).
